# Contributing to Penko Software

Thank you for your interest in Penko Software. This document explains how you can contribute to the project.

## About This Repository

The Penko Software Hub is a **showcase and landing page** for all Penko Software projects. This repository contains only the front-end hub interface for discovering and accessing our applications.

## Code Contributions

### This Repository (Penko Software Hub)

We **do not accept code contributions** to the hub itself. The hub is maintained as a curated showcase by the project maintainer to ensure consistency and quality across the Penko Software ecosystem.

### Individual Projects

We **welcome contributions** to the actual Penko Software projects. Each project has its own repository where you can:

- Submit bug fixes
- Propose new features
- Improve documentation
- Add translations
- Write tests

To contribute to a specific project, visit its repository:
